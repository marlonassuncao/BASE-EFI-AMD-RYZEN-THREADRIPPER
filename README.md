# ACPI Tables - AMD

These files are **MUST** be included in your EFI's ACPI directory. We recommend that you use the **MANUAL** method, but for a first test you can use the prebuild versions.

Table|Description
:----|:----
SSDT-EC-USBX|[Manual](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Universal/ec-methods/manual.html) \| [Prebuilt](https://github.com/dortania/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/raw/master/extra-files/compiled/SSDT-EC-USBX-DESKTOP.aml) \| [Details](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Universal/ec-fix.html)
SSDT-CPUR|[Prebuilt](https://github.com/dortania/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/raw/master/extra-files/compiled/SSDT-CPUR.aml) <br> *Only for B550 and A520*

### Dumping your DSDT in Windows Environment
[Download iASL Compiler ACPI Tools](https://acpica.org/downloads/binary-tools)
<br><br>
Open the CMD in the directory where the *ACPI Tools* was extracted. (*Command Prompt*) in **Administrator Mode**:
```
path/to/acpidump.exe -b -n DSDT -z
mv dsdt.dat DSDT.aml
```

Decompile DSDT.aml:
```
path/to/iasl.exe path/to/DSDT.aml
```
*File DSDT.dsl will generated. Use this for generate YOUR ACPI Patches.* 

Compile DSDT.dsl:
```
path/to/iasl.exe path/to/DSDT.dsl
```
*File APCPI_FILE_PATCHED.aml will generated.*

# Attention

Update **config.plist** in PlatformInfo > Generic with YOUR informations.
<br><br>
*1. MLB (Board Serial)
<br>
2. ROM (Mac Address)
<br>
3. SystemSerialNumber (Serial)
<br>
4. SystemUUID (SmUUID)*

Please use [*genSMBIOS*](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for generate values for above itens.

Please use [*ProperTree*](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for configure/edit your config.plist.

# Compatible SMBIOS

SMBIOS|Description
:----|:----
iMacPro1,1|AMD RX Polaris and newer.
MacPro7,1|AMD RX Polaris and newer.<br>Note that MacPro7,1 is exclusive to macOS 10.15, Catalina and newer.
MacPro6,1|AMD R5/R7/R9 and older.
iMac14,2|Nvidia Kepler and newer.<br>Note: iMac14,2 is only supported to macOS 10.8-10.15, for macOS 11, Big Sur and newer please use MacPro7,1.

# Special notes

- USB port mapping is **REQUIRED**.
- **`XhciPortLimit`** - Needed **`DISABLE`** if you use Big Sur 11.3+. 
	- Please Mapping USB in macOS Catalina before install Big Sur or Newer for best results.
	- You can use USBMap.command Utility - [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap).
- **`SetupVirtualMap`** in config.plist:
	- B550, A520 and TRx40 boards should **`DISABLE`** this;
	- Newer BIOS versions of X570 also require this **`DISABLE`**;
	- X470 and B450 with late 2020 BIOS updates also require this **`DISABLE`**.
- **`DevirtualiseMmio`** - TRx40 users please **`ENABLE`** this flag.

### General Purpose `boot-args`

Parameter|Description
:----|:----
npci=0x2000|This disables some PCI debugging related to `kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64`, alternative is `npci=0x3000` which disables debugging related to `gIOPCITunnelledKey` in addition.<br>Required for when getting stuck on `PCI Start Configuration` as there are IRQ conflicts relating to your PCI lanes. **Not needed if Above4GDecoding is enabled.**
npci=0x3000|Alternative for `npci=0x2000`.

### GPU-Specific `boot-args`

Parameter|Description
:----|:----
agdpmod=pikera|Used for disabling board ID checks on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.<br>**Don't use if you don't have Navi** (ie. Polaris and Vega cards shouldn't use this).
nvda_drv_vrl=1|Used for enabling Nvidia's Web Drivers on Maxwell and Pascal cards in Sierra and High Sierra.

# BIOS Settings

### Disable
- Fast Boot
- Secure Boot
- Serial/COM Port
- Parallel Port
- Compatibility Support Module (CSM)(Must be off, GPU errors like `gIO` are common when this option in enabled)

***Special note for 3990X users***: *macOS currently does not support more than 64 threads in the kernel, and so will kernel panic if it sees more. The 3990X CPU has 128 threads total and so requires half of that disabled. We recommend disabling hyper threading in the BIOS for these situations.*

### Enable
- Above 4G decoding
	- This must be on, if you can't find the option then add `npci=0x2000` to `boot-args`. 
	- Do not have both this option and `npci` in `boot-args` enabled at the same time.
	- If you are on a Gigabyte/Aorus or an AsRock motherboard, enabling this option may break certain drivers(ie. Ethernet) and/or boot failures on other OSes, if it does happen then disable this option and opt for `npci` instead.
	- 2020+ BIOS Notes: When enabling Above4G, Resizable BAR Support may become an available on some X570 and newer motherboards. Please ensure this is **`DISABLED`** instead of set to Auto.
- EHCI/XHCI Hand-off
- OS type: Windows 8.1/10 UEFI Mode
- SATA Mode: AHCI
